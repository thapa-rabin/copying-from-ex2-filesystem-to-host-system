# Copying-Files-To-and-From-EXT2-Filesystem

Operating System Class' Term Project 

Goals: 
1. Design and implement a software that copies files out of a Virtual Disk Image (VDI) file containing a Linux ext2 filesystem to a host system without corrupting the VDI filesystem. 
2. List all files and directories in the given VDI filesystem.
3. Develop the software such that the software’s file listing provides the same information as a “long list” in UNIX (i.e., ls -l).
